## 🏗 Architecture (3-Tier)

### 🖥 1️⃣ Presentation Layer (PL)
- Windows Forms UI
- Handles user interaction
- Displays data and receives input
- Communicates only with Business Layer

### 🧠 2️⃣ Business Logic Layer (BLL)
- Contains business rules
- Validates data
- Controls application workflow
- Decides when and how data should be saved or retrieved

### 💾 3️⃣ Data Access Layer (DAL)
- Handles database communication
- Uses ADO.NET (SqlConnection, SqlCommand, SqlDataReader)
- Executes stored procedures / queries
- Isolated from UI

This separation improves:
- Code maintainability
- Testability
- Scalability
- Clean architecture principles

---

## 🗄 Database Features
- Fully relational database
- Primary & Foreign Keys
- Data integrity enforcement
- Business rule constraints
- License-test-application lifecycle tracking

---

## ✨ Core Functionalities
- People & Drivers Management
- License Applications
- Test Scheduling & Results
- License Issuance / Renewal / Replacement
- Detained License Management
